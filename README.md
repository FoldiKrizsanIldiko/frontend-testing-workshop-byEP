# Frontend testing workshop

This repository contains all the materials for the Frontend Testing workshop. A small React app is provided to write tests for it. We only discuss Javascript testing frameworks and libraries here.

# System under testing

The [React app](./tourist-app/) we test in this workshop is a simplified version of the [Fetch the Globe](https://journey.study/v2/learn/courses/252/modules/32753/units/4/SOLO/57202) Journey project that uses the Tourist API (hosted by Codecool).

# Tests

## Unit tests
See a couple of examples in the [tourist-app/tests/unit-tests](./tourist-app/tests/unit-tests/) folder.

## Integration tests
